/* Less is a CSS pre-processor, meaning that it extends the CSS language,
 * adding features that allow variables, mixins, functions and many other 
 * techniques that allow you to make CSS that is more maintainable, themable and extendable.
 * Less runs in Node. In meteor less is packaged with $ meteor add less
 * Less for Bootstrap is packaged with $ mrt bootstrap-less
